# Lab 06: Authenticate by using OpenID Connect, MSAL, and .NET SDKs

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will register an application in Microsoft Entra ID, add a user, and then test the user’s access to the application to validate that Entra ID can secure it. You will also use the Graph Explorer tool to build and test requests against the Graph API for an Microsoft Entra ID user account.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

+ Exercise 1: Configure a single-tenant Entra ID environment
+ Exercise 2: Create a single-tenant ASP.NET web app
      
## Estimated timing: 60 minutes

### Review

In this exercise, you registered a single-tenant Azure AD application and created an Azure AD user account.

# Exercise 2: Create a single-tenant ASP.NET web app

In this exercise, you implement a single-tenant web app and test it in a single-tenant Azure environment.

## Task 1: Create an ASP.NET web app project

1.  In the lab vm search and select the **Command Prompt**.

1.  From the command prompt, run the following commands to create and set the working directory to **Allfiles (C):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\06\\Solutiom\\OIDCClientST**:

    
    ```powershell
    md "C:\AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure\Allfiles\Labs\06\Solution\OIDCClient"
    ```
     ```powershell
    cd C:\AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure\Allfiles\Labs\06\Solution\OIDCClient
    ```

1.  Run the following commands to create a new .NET Core web app based on the Model View Controller (MVC) template (replace the placeholders `<application_ID>`, `<tenant_ID>`, and `<domain_Name>` with the corresponding values you recorded earlier in this lab):

    ```powershell
    dotnet new mvc --auth SingleOrg --client-id <application_ID> --tenant-id <tenant_ID> --domain <domain_Name>
    ```
    
    ```powershell
    rmdir .\obj /S /Q
    ```

1.  Open the **Visual Studio Code** from the task bar.

    -  In the **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.
    -  In the **File Explorer** window, browse to **C:\AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure\Allfiles\Labs\06\Solution**, and then select **Select Folder OIDCClient**.
     
    - If you have been prompted **Do you trust the authors of all files in this folder?**, select **Yes, I trust the authors**.

1.  In the Visual Studio Code **Explorer** pane, review the autogenerated folder structure that represents an MVC web app.

1.  Navigate to the **Properties** folder, open the **launchSettings.json** file, and then apply the following changes:

    
    | Section         | Property           | Value                                                   |
    | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **iisSettings** | **sslPort**        | **44321**                                               |
    | **iisSettings**  | **applicationUrl** | `https://localhost:44321` |
    | **https**  | **applicationUrl** | `https://localhost:5001` |      

    > **Note**: The port numbers must match the value you specified when creating the Azure AD app registration.

1.  Save and close the file.

1.  In the Visual Studio Code **Explorer** pane, select **OIDCClient.csproj**.

1.  Ensure that the value of `<TargetFramework>` element is set to **net8.0**.

1.  Ensure that version of the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect` NuGet packages is set to **8.0.0**.

1.  Verify that the content of the **OIDCClient.csproj** file resembles the following listing (the value of the `UserSecretsId`will differ) and save the changes.

    > **Note**: Don't copy and paste this command because it will throw an error, just review and verify this code.

    ```csharp
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

      <PropertyGroup>
        <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
        <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
        <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
        <UserSecretsId>aspnet-OIDCClient-5249f5b2-6266-4a13-b8b4-e79c6443aabc</UserSecretsId>
      </PropertyGroup>

      <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer" Version="8.0.0-rc.2.23480.2" NoWarn="NU1605" />
        <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect" Version="8.0.0-rc.2.23480.2" NoWarn="NU1605" />
        <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web" Version="2.13.0" />

        <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Identity.Web.DownstreamApi" Version="2.13.0" />
      </ItemGroup>

    </Project>
    ```

1.  Close the **OIDCClient.csproj** file.

1.  In the explorer Navigate to the **Views\Shared** folder, and then open the **_LoginPartial.cshtml** file.

1.  Verify that the `asp-area` attribute in each span element references `MicrosoftIdentity`, as in the following line:

    ```csharp
    <a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="MicrosoftIdentity" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignOut">Sign out</a>
    ```

1.  Close the file without making any changes.

1.  Open the file **appsettings.json** and review the content of the **AzureAd** object, including the following elements:

    | Element | Value |
    | -- | -- |
    | `Instance` | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/`|
    | `Domain` | Primary DNS domain of the Azure AD tenant associated with your Azure subscription |
    | `TenantId` | GUID of the Azure AD tenant |
    | `ClientId` | Application (client) ID of the application you registered in the Azure AD tenant |
    | `CallbackPath` | `/signin-oidc` |

1.  Close the file without making any changes.
3.  In the Visual Studio Code **Explorer** pane, select **Program.cs**.
4.  Verify that the file contains the following **using** directives:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
    using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
    using Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI;
    ```

1.  Verify that the file contains the following lines that add the relevant authentication services to the container:

    ```csharp
    builder.services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
      .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"));
    ```

1.  Verify that the file contains the following lines that add a controller and Razor pages for the accounts management:

    ```csharp
    builder.services.AddRazorPages()
      .AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
    ```

1.  Save and close the file.

### Task 2: Test the single-tenant web app in a single-tenant scenario

1.  In the **Visual Studio Code** window, right-click on the blank space inside the **Explorer** pane, and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal**.

    ![](./media/az204-6-21.png)   

1.  Run the following commands to build the .NET web app:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

    > **Note**: If there are any build errors, review the files in the **Allfiles C:\\AZ-204 --  DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure\\Allfiles\\Labs\\06\\Solution\\OIDCClient** folder.

1.  Run the following command to generate a self-signed certificate and configure the local computer to trust it:

    ```
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust
    ```

1.  When prompted to install the autogenerated certificate, select **Yes**.

1.  From the terminal prompt, run the following command to run the .NET web app:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

1.  Start the Microsoft Edge browser in the **InPrivate** mode, and then navigate to the `https://localhost:5001` URL.

1.  If presented with the **Your connection isn't private** message, select **Advanced**, and then select the **Continue to localhost (unsafe)** link.

1.  In the open browser window, when prompted, authenticate by using the UPN of the **aad_lab_user1** Azure AD account you created earlier and copied in this lab with **Pa55w.rd1234** as its password.

1.  The browser window will automatically open the **Permissions requested** webpage.

1.  Review the requested permissions, which include **View your basic profile** and **Maintain access to data you have given it access to**.

1.  Select **Accept**.

1.  Review the **Welcome** home page of the target site displayed by the browser and verify that the UPN of the **aad_user1** Azure AD account appears in the browser window.

1.  On the **Welcome** page, select **Sign out**.

1.  When prompted to select the account to sign out, select the **aad_lab_user1** Azure AD account. You'll be automatically redirected to the **Signed out** page.

1.  Leave the Microsoft Edge browser open that displays the **Signed out** page.
