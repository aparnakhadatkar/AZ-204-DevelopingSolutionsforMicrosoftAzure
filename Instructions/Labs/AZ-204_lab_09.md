# Lab 09: Publish and subscribe to Event Grid events

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will start with a proof-of-concept web app, hosted in a container, that will be used to subscribe to your Event Grid. This app will allow you to submit events and receive confirmation messages that the events were successful.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

+ Exercise 1: Create Azure resources
+ Exercise 2: Create an Event Grid subscription
+ Exercise 3: Publish Event Grid events from .NET
   
## Estimated timing: 60 minutes

## Architecture diagram

## Exercise 2: Create an Event Grid subscription

In this exercise, you create a new subscription, validate its registration, and then record the credentials required to publish a new event to the topic.

### Task 1: Access the Event Grid Viewer web application

1. On the Azure portal's navigation pane, select **Resource groups**.

1. On the **Resource groups** blade, select the **PubSubEvents-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group.

1. On the **PubSubEvents-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** blade, select the **eventviewer<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** web app.

1. Click the **Browse** button while you're still in the **Overview** section.

1. Observe the currently running **Azure Event Grid Viewer** web application. Leave this web application running for the remainder of the lab.

    > **Note**: This web application will update in real-time as events are sent to its endpoint. You'll use this application to monitor events throughout the lab.

1. Return to your currently open browser window that displays the Azure portal.

### Task 2: Create a new subscription

### Review

In this exercise, you created a new subscription, validated its registration, and then recorded the credentials required to publish a new event on the topic.

## Exercise 3: Publish Event Grid events from .NET

In this exercise, you publish new events to your Event Grid topic by using a .NET console application.

### Task 1: Create a .NET project

1. On the **Start** screen, select the **Visual Studio Code** tile.

1. On the **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.

1. In the **File Explorer** window that opens, browse to **C:\AllFiles\AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure-master\Allfiles\Labs\09\Starter**, and then select **EventPublisher** Folder.

1. On the **Visual Studio Code** pop-up select **Yes, I trust the authors**.

1. In the **Visual Studio Code** window, from its top menu bar, go to **Terminal** menu and select **New Terminal**.

1. Run the following command to create a new .NET project named **EventPublisher** in the current folder:

    ```powershell
    dotnet new console --framework net8.0 --name EventPublisher --output .
    ```

    > **Note**: The **dotnet new** command will create a new **console** project in a folder with the same name as the project.

1. Run the following command to import version 4.11.0 of **Azure.Messaging.EventGrid** from NuGet:

    ```powershell
    dotnet add package Azure.Messaging.EventGrid --version 4.11.0
    ```

    > **Note**: The **dotnet add package** command will add the **Microsoft.Azure.EventGrid** package from NuGet. For more information, go to [Azure.Messaging.EventGrid](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Messaging.EventGrid/4.11.0).

1. Run the following command to build the .NET web application:

    ```powershell
    dotnet build
    ```

1. Select **Kill Terminal** or the **Recycle Bin** icon to close the currently open terminal and any associated processes.

### Task 2: Modify the Program class to connect to Event Grid

1. On the **Explorer** pane of the **Visual Studio Code** window, open the **Program.cs** file.

1. On the code editor tab for the **Program.cs** file, delete all the code in the existing file.
  
1. **Add the following** of code and update the **topic-endpoint** and **topic-key** placeholders with their respective values recorded earlier and Save the file.

    ```csharp
    using Azure;
    using Azure.Messaging.EventGrid;
    using System;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;    
    public class Program
    {
        private const string topicEndpoint = "<topic-endpoint>";
        /* Update the topicEndpoint string constant by setting its value to the Topic
           Endpoint of the Event Grid topic that you recorded previously in this lab. */
        private const string topicKey = "<topic-key>";   
        /* Update the topicKey string constant by setting its value to the Key of the Event Grid topic that you recorded previously in this lab. */     
        public static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Add Main code here
        }
    }
    ```

### Task 3: Publish new events

1. Add the following code in the **Main** method of **Program.cs** file:
   
    ```csharp
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {   
        /* To create a new variable named "endpoint" of type "Uri", 
           using the "topicEndpoint" string constant as a constructor parameter */
        Uri endpoint = new Uri(topicEndpoint);

        /* To create a new variable named "credential" of type "AzureKeyCredential",
           use the "topicKey" string constant as a constructor parameter. */
        AzureKeyCredential credential = new AzureKeyCredential(topicKey);

        /* To create a new variable named "client" of type "EventGridPublisherClient", 
           using the "endpoint" and "credential" variables as constructor parameters */
        EventGridPublisherClient client = new EventGridPublisherClient(endpoint, credential);

        /* To create a new variable named "firstEvent" of type "EventGridEvent",
           and populate that variable with sample data */        
        EventGridEvent firstEvent = new EventGridEvent(
            subject: $"New Employee: Alba Sutton",
            eventType: "Employees.Registration.New",
            dataVersion: "1.0",
            data: new
            {
                FullName = "Alba Sutton",
                Address = "4567 Pine Avenue, Edison, WA 97202"
            }
        );

        /* To create a new variable named "secondEvent" of type "EventGridEvent",
           and populate that variable with sample data */
        EventGridEvent secondEvent = new EventGridEvent(
            subject: $"New Employee: Alexandre Doyon",
            eventType: "Employees.Registration.New",
            dataVersion: "1.0",
            data: new
            {
                FullName = "Alexandre Doyon",
                Address = "456 College Street, Bow, WA 98107"
            }
        );

        /* To asynchronously invoke the "EventGridPublisherClient.SendEventAsync"
           method using the "firstEvent" variable as a parameter */
        await client.SendEventAsync(firstEvent);
        Console.WriteLine("First event published");

        /* To asynchronously invoke the "EventGridPublisherClient.SendEventAsync"
           method using the "secondEvent" variable as a parameter */
        await client.SendEventAsync(secondEvent);
        Console.WriteLine("Second event published");
    }
    ```
